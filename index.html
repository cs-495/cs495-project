<p>Kitty Paint is an android application aimed at users who want to have the ability to create simple creative works of art either collaboratively or by themselves, on the go. The application has two main versions in which it is available two the user. The first is, of course, through the Android application itself. The second is actually on the specially designed Kitty Paint Web Application hosted on the Kitty Paint servers that any user on any device can connect to. Both modes have similar functionality and are fully compatible with one another. Once connected to Kitty Paint, users can begin to utilize the different brushes and stamps included in the application and begin drawing their creations with their friends. </p>
